## *The Data*

These nationally representative datasets were created by the NHANES Program, consisting of partial 2019-2020 data combined with full data of the 2017-2018 cycle. The original datasets themselves cover a variety of health topics surveyed to and tested on individuals; demographics, body measurements, blood pressure & cholesterol, and medical conditions are the specific datasets that I have chosen.

## *The Purpose*

The goal with this data is to answer the question of "What is the correlation between liver diseases and high blood pressure, and how do different demographics play a role in this correlation?". In order to answer this question, processes of data cleaning, data plotting, data analyzing, hypothesis testing, and machine learning are involved.

## *The Results*

-   The majority of those with a liver condition also have hypertension.
-   It is most probable to be diagnosed with hypertension before you are diagnosed with a liver condition.
-   Marriage has no effect on whether or not you are diagnosed with hypertension or a liver condition.
-   Hispanic people are more likely to have a liver condition than Black, White, and multi-racial people.
